# Radionuclide Release Analysis:

The following Data Analysis was performed by **Alan Rial** (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alan-rial/) for **Nuclear Transparency Project**, and was finalized on 10/24/2022. The main objective of this exercise is to analyze the quality of open-access radionuclide release datasets, by identifying patterns, trends, unusual values, and missing data to inform regulatory legal submissions related to nuclear transparency and data disclosure for the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission (CNSC).

## 4 Categories of facilities to analyze:

- Nuclear Power Plants
- Nuclear Processing Facilities
- Canadian Nuclear Laboratories
- Uranium Mines and Mills

## About NTP:

The **Nuclear Transparency Project (NTP)** is a Canadian-registered not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting open, informed, and equitable public discourse on nuclear technologies. NTP advocates for robust public access to data and other types of information and helps to produce accessible analysis of publicly available information, all with a view to supporting greater transparency in the Canadian nuclear sector. NTP is comprised of a multi-disciplinary group of experts working to examine the economic, ecological, and social facets and impacts of the Canadian nuclear sector. The organization produces public reports, academic articles, and other publicly accessible resources. It also regularly intervenes in nuclear regulatory decision-making processes. The organization seeks to support youth and early career scholars, especially those from underrepresented communities in their respective disciplines. NTP also recognizes a responsibility to model the transparency and accountability practices for which it advocates. We are committed to interdisciplinary, cross-sectoral, and equitable collaborations and dialogue between regulators, industry, civil society, members of host and potential host communities, as well as academics and professionals from science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) fields, the social sciences, and humanities.
